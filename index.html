      <h1>Southern Pecan</h1>

      <p>
        I went to live with my grandmother back in 2009, after a pretty bad split between my mom and my then stepdad, the dad of my little brother. 
        I left the typical, polished suburbs, with paved streets and manicured lawns, a great school system, and infrastructure, for a poor, small town in Mississippi. 
        Having left the suburbs for somewhere that in a lot of ways seemed like a different world was something that I was not akin to. 
        We moved to a neighborhood consisting of trailer homes and a blend of small, run-down houses — a place where, instead of perfectly manicured lawns, 
        non-operational vehicles now littered people's front yards.
      </p>

      <p>
        My grandmother was a stern woman; she grew up in that same house that I was now a new resident in. 
        A house that was full of blues and R&B and has aged alongside her. She was 5'7", had a round nose like me, the same hooded eyes, similar complexion, and the same smile. 
        I look a lot like her. I look a lot like my mom, who looks a lot like my grandmother. 
        I relished in the fact that I took after her, the woman who raised me for a considerable chunk of my life. 
        From having our own rooms and beds to now sharing one, I often wondered why my life became the way it was. 
        Why couldn’t it be different? I had a lot of anger and contempt toward my grandmother’s house. 
        However, nonetheless, I loved my grandmother and where my roots hail from.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that I have moved out and am an adult, I have been thinking a lot about grief. 
        It’s something that we all experience, but we never know when. There is an invisible clock that counts down to when we will face it. 
        I think about my grandmother, who, although she’s still with us, reminds me that it’s only a matter of when, not if. 
        The same woman I have inherited my nose, eyes, and way of speaking from.
      </p>

      <p>
        She once told me that I look like her mother. I never met her, nor do I know how she looked, but that made me realize that maybe this is how we all live forever. 
        No one truly dies; they live on in us. 
        And one day, when I am old and have kids or grandkids, I’ll tell them about my grandmother. 
        If they are running late, I’ll tell them they’re just like Marilyn Lawston. 
        If they’re stubborn, unwilling to let things go, or hate to admit they’re wrong, I’ll say the same. 
        She’s like a pecan, hard on the outside but soft, buttery, and warm in the center. 
        And when I’m old and want to see my grandma again, I’ll just look in the mirror, and she’ll be staring right back at me, smiling.
